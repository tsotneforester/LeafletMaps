# about

_**Leaflet Maps**_ packs main and common features that every customized map has and every GIS specialist knows:

- Points (Markers, Circles)
- Polygons
- Popups
- Geojson

if suddelny [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) documentray seems hard to understend, you will benefit from this project!

<!-- # Points are handled differently than polylines and polygons. By default simple markers are drawn for GeoJSON Points. We can alter this by passing a pointToLayer function in a GeoJSON options object when creating the GeoJSON layer. -->
